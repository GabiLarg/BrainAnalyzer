## About

Brainalyzer is the sentiment analysis machine of the 21st century.
Get instant insights from how your employees really feel.

## Motivation

We believe the social environment is very important to the company. Thinking about that, how we can engage our employees to get know each other and make a better connection by related interests? 
We created a tool that uses data analysis to uderstand the users interests and match the coworkers would be interesting to know and find most interesting events to share based on the data provided by the social tool.

### Technologies

- Google Cloud API for sentiment analysis
- Visual Studio
- Google Chrome
- Boostrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### FYI
We could not make the local Google Cloud API work and therefore this project is incomplete.
We apologize for this incovenience, but we tried our best.
